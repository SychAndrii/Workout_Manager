# Group 02 Working Agreement

### Purpose

This document serves as a guideline for how our Scrum team will work together to create a positive and productive environment.

### Methodology

Our chosen agile development methodology is Test Driven Development.  
This means, that tests will be created first, and the only code implemented would be to make the tests pass.

### 1- Communication

**Platform**: All communication will be conducted through [Discord](https://discord.com/).  
**Response Time**: During core hours, team members should respond within 30 minutes.  
**Transparency**: All team members commit to being open about their work and any challenges they encounter.

### 2- Meetings

**Punctuality**: All team members will join meetings on time. If someone knows they are going to be late, they must inform the rest of the team in advance.  
**Engagement**: Actively participate in meetings, avoid multitasking, and keep cameras on to foster engagement.  
**Daily Standup**: Held at 7:30 PM, and will not exceed 10 minutes. Each member will share updates following the standard format.  
**Missed Meetings**: If at any point a member of Group 02 misses a meeting, it will be noted, and Professor Marcel will be informed.

### 3- Respect and Collaboration

**Feedback**: Provide constructive feedback, and receive feedback graciously.  
**Interruptions**: Avoid interrupting others. Use hand raises or designated signals in virtual meetings when wanting to speak.  
**Differences**: Embrace diverse viewpoints and resolve disagreements through discussion or, if necessary, a designated decision-maker.

### 4- Work Management

**Work Limit**: Limit the number of Work In Progress items to ensure quality and focus.  
**Updates**: Keep the Scrum board (or equivalent) updated in real-time to reflect current work status.

### 5- Availability and Core Hours

**Core Hours**: All team members will be available from 3:00 PM to 9:00 PM.  
**Time Off**: Inform the team at least 48 hours in advance if planning to take time off.

### 6- Continuous Improvement

**Retrospectives**: Actively participate and be open to process changes resulting from retrospective discussions.  
**Learning**: Share useful resources, articles, or learnings with the team on a weekly basis.

### 7- Tools and Technology

**Primary Tools**: Use GitHub for tracking tasks and for documentation.  
**Training**: If unfamiliar with a tool, seek training and be open to assisting others in learning.

### 8- Version Control Rules

    - Never commit directly to the main branch.
    - Review all pull requests (at least 1 approval).
    - Review pull requests in less than 2 days.
    - Merge only when all unit and integration test pass.

### Agreement and Review

All members of Group02 have collaborated to create this working agreement.
We commit to upholding these guidelines. We'll review and update this agreement during our retrospectives or as needed.
