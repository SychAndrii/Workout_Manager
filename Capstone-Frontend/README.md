## Vercel Domain
We chose to use Vercel as it is the first choice for any team that chooses nextjs as their react framework for frontend development. It is fast, easy, and convenient.

You can access our hosted app on vercel [here](https://agility-tau.vercel.app/).

# CSS Framework
**Tailwind CSS** is a popular choice for Next.js projects due to its utility-first approach, which facilitates rapid development and design consistency without the overhead of managing complex CSS files. By enabling developers to apply styling directly within HTML markup, **Tailwind CSS** significantly accelerates the development process, allowing for quick iterations and responsive design with minimal effort.
