# Coding Standards for Agility.com Development

## Introduction

This document outlines the coding standards and best practices for the development of Agility. Adhering to these standards ensures code quality, maintainability, and consistency across the application's codebase.

## General Principles

1. **Readability and Maintainability**: Code should be easy to read and understand. Opt for clarity over cleverness.
2. **Consistency**: Follow a consistent coding style throughout the application.
3. **Commenting and Documentation**: Write meaningful comments and maintain up-to-date documentation.

## JavaScript and TypeScript Standards

### Style and Formatting

1. **Indentation**: Use tab for indentation.
2. **Semicolons**: Use semicolons to end statements.
3. **Variable Naming**: Use camelCase for function names, PascalCase for class names, camelCase for variable names.
4. **Constants**: Use UPPER_CASE for constants.

### Best Practices

1. **Use 'let' and 'const'**: Prefer 'let' and 'const' over 'var'.
2. **Arrow Functions**: Use arrow functions for anonymous functions where appropriate.
3. **Async/Await**: Prefer async/await over traditional callback structures for asynchronous code.

## React (Next.js) Standards

1. **Component Structure**: Organize components logically and reuse components where possible.
2. **State Management**: Clearly define state management strategies and keep them consistent.
3. **Hooks**: Use React hooks for state and lifecycle management in functional components.

## CSS (Tailwind) Standards

1. **Responsive Design**: Ensure styles cater to various screen sizes and devices.
2. **Utility-First**: Utilize Tailwind's utility classes primarily and custom CSS sparingly.
3. **Consistent Theming**: Adhere to a predefined color scheme and theme.

## Backend (NodeJS, Express) Standards

1. **RESTful APIs**: Design APIs to be RESTful and stateless.
2. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling and logging.
3. **Security**: Follow security best practices, including input validation and proper authentication/authorization checks.

## Version Control (Git)

1. **Branching Strategy**: Adhere to a consistent branching strategy like Git Flow.
2. **Commit Messages**: Write clear, concise commit messages describing the changes made.
3. **Code Reviews**: Regularly conduct code reviews to maintain code quality.

## Testing (Jest, Hurl)

1. **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for individual components/functions.
2. **Integration Testing**: Perform integration testing to ensure different parts of the application work together seamlessly.
3. **Continuous Testing**: Integrate testing into the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

## Continuous Improvement

1. **Code Refactoring**: Regularly refactor code to improve quality and address technical debt.
2. **Peer Reviews**: Engage in peer reviews to share knowledge and improve code quality.
3. **Stay Updated**: Keep abreast of the latest developments in technology and incorporate them where appropriate.
