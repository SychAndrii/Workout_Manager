# Security Guidelines for Agility

## Introduction

Agility is committed to ensuring the security and privacy of our users' data. These guidelines outline the measures we take and recommend for safeguarding your information within our fitness tracking and community-sharing application.

## User Data Protection

### Account Security

1. **Strong Authentication**: Utilize AWS Cognito for robust user authentication.
2. **Password Policies**: Enforce strong password policies, including minimum length, complexity requirements, and regular password updates.
3. **Account Privacy Settings**: Allow users to control their privacy settings, including what is shared publicly and what remains private.

### Data Encryption

1. **In-Transit Encryption**: Use HTTPS with TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt data transmitted between the userâ€™s device and our servers.
2. **At-Rest Encryption**: Ensure all sensitive data, including user details and workout logs, are encrypted when stored in our databases and file storage systems.

## Application Security

### Frontend and Backend Security

1. **Code Security**: Regularly scan code for vulnerabilities using tools like Jest and Hurl in our development process.
2. **API Security**: Secure all APIs using industry-standard protocols and practices.
3. **Input Validation**: Implement robust input validation to prevent SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other injection attacks.

### Database Security

1. **Access Controls**: Limit database access to authorized personnel only. Use role-based access controls within DynamoDB.
2. **Regular Backups**: Perform regular backups of the database to prevent data loss.

## Data Privacy

1. **Data Minimization**: Collect only the data necessary for the intended purpose.
2. **User Consent**: Obtain explicit consent from users before collecting, processing, or sharing their data.

## Incident Response

1. **Rapid Response Plan**: Develop and maintain an incident response plan for quickly addressing security breaches.
2. **Notification Procedures**: Establish procedures for notifying affected users and relevant authorities in the event of a data breach.

## User Education and Awareness

**Updates and Notifications**: Keep users informed about updates to security policies and practices.

## Continuous Improvement

1. **Regular Updates and Patches**: Routinely update software components and apply security patches.
2. **Feedback Loop**: Encourage user feedback on security concerns and continuously improve based on user input and emerging threats.
